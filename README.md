Employee Workforce Analysis & Dashboard
Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive analysis of employee workforce data, focusing on departmental distributions, compensation trends, and demographic insights. Using Excel, I processed raw employee records to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that help organization leaders make data-driven decisions regarding human resources.

Key Insights & KPIs
Through this analysis, I tracked the following high-level metrics:

Total Headcount: Total number of active employees across all departments.

Compensation Analysis: Identification of the top 10 highest-paid employees to understand salary distribution.

Departmental Breakdown: A percentage-based view of how the workforce is distributed across various business units.

Demographics: Visualizing the age range and gender balance within the company to monitor diversity and inclusion.

Data Structure
The analysis is built upon several key data components:

Employee Records: Raw data including names, IDs, and hiring information.

KPI Summary: Aggregated metrics for quick executive review.

Departmental Metrics: Calculations showing the concentration of staff in each department.

Top Earners: A filtered list of leadership and high-impact compensation levels.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: * Pivot Tables: Used for summarizing large datasets and calculating percentages.

Data Cleaning: Ensuring consistency in gender and department naming conventions.

Advanced Formulas: Used for calculating age ranges and performance metrics.

GitHub: For version control and project documentation.
